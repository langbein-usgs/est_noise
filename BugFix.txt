Various bug fixes

version 20160301  relative to 20151217
In bust_5,  -- The median routine would stop if there was no data in the specified interval-- bust_5 would crash
     Fixed by specifing a median of zero when there is no data in interval under examination

est_noise7.22 --  
 1  For the legacy-mode (quadature covariance) AND when dec .ne. 0  AND when the exponential 
   time constant is being estimated, there was an artifical offset introduced in the resid.out file in
   both the predicted and residuals...  This should be fixed as the A_orig matrix, prior to
   outputting the residual wasn't correctly being modified (modify_A routine) because the number of
   observations, ic was being correctly passed through the common statement;  Line numbers ~1735 changed
   in est_noise7.22

2  Note the for intel compiled program on Mac, that estimating PL index yield an "illegal instruction"
   and program crashes.  Works OK with gfortran, though. This seems to occur using 2-color EDM data and
   independent of whether covariance is additive or quadrature. After fiddling with the dimensions
   of makeMatrix, and band_pass_filt subroutines, the programs had problems compiling either with gfortran
   or intel, depending on the dimension statemments. With gfortran, compile errors consisted of
   "RIP relative reference out of range ".  So, for arrays that were originally dimensioned as 65536, I reduced
    them by a factor of two to 32768.  

3  For infrequent instances of BP noise and using the "fast" version of creating and evaluating the data
   covariance matrix, est_noise would not provide reliable results --- This would be evident either that
   A)  the output has a lot of NaN in the columns representing the determinant and/or the misfit of
   of the data to the model (chi^2)  or B)  the MLE value is wildly different than simpler models of noise;
   that is a model with the BP component. With the "c" or cholesky option, BP noise modeling worked fine.
   To try to get around this, I implimented DFT (and its inverse) to compute
   the inverse filter (finv in funmin).  The apparent problem, I believe, is that the filter function of
   noise composed of BP noise is oscilatory. Inverting that filter-function, especially by de-convolution, would
   amplify those oscillations without bound (the near-zero crossing points, when inverted, become unbounded).
   The "badness" of the oscillations is tested by convolving
   the filter function with its inverse (a test feature in funmin) and it would go unbounded. I tested
   various DFTs (with different tapers and no-taper). Although convoluting the inverse filter with the filter
   provided a better match to the expected delta function, it wasn't always perfect.  Consequently, the
   results of modeling data error (some, but not all) would converge, but the MLEs and the amplitudes were not
   consistent with the results obtained from cholesky decomposition.  Consequently, I abandoned the DFT
   approach (the code is commented-out) and I will provide a warning in the manual that, should the
   BP modeling either not work or provides obviously in correct results, that the user needs to switch
   to the cholesky mode.  In addition, the example script, EstNoiseAll.sh has been modified --- it will run the "fast"
   version of the covariance for BP noise, but if that fails, it will rerun using cholesky decomposition.

4  For the 'f' fast option of noise modeling and simultaneouly estimating the time-constants of exponentials
   or omori function, the code would not consistently converge.  It worked fine in the 'c', cholesky and 'n',
   legacy/quadrature mode.  This has been fixed.... For the 'f' version, the wrong A-matrix was being modified.

Version 20160401
est_noise7.22
1  At times, Nelder/Mead doesn't find the optimal solution -- it could exceed the number of iterations or, it
   claims convergence, but after testing through "dithering" the optimal solution, a better solution is found.
   If after dithering, a better solution is found, then the program is instructed to JUMP backwards, and
   re-run Nelder/Mead once more.  This is flagged with a iFlagReLoop variable.
2  Noted that offsets specified for the last observation would stop the program; revised if statement for -ge to
   -gt to allow last observation to be an offset point.
3  This is an additional feature.  For both the white noise and the first colored noise, the program can, if desired
   provide a suggested input for the amplitudes of white and colored noise. It is ad-hoc, but is probably gets
   one in the neighborhood and, consequently, it could speed-up the computations as the initial guess is closer
   to the trueth.  To invoke this feature, when either white or First power law amplitude is requested, enter
   "-99999.0 float".

Version 20160601
1  Fixed GMT formated output in est_noise
2  Changed maximum variance allowable in compare_wander2 Changed maximum variance allowable in compare_wander
3  Added new feature to EstNoiseAll.sh script to limit the number of noise models tested
   with est_noise.  This new feature is the -S argument.

Version 20160801
1  Modify the EstNoiseAll.sh script such that FLRW is used that the default with BPx noise. However, if
   PL noise is desired, use the -P flag.

Version 20170217
1  Noted that for some cases, est_noise would continuously loop on dithering the optimal solution
   (needed to estimate error bars on noise parameters). Earlier versions would test the number of dithered
   attempts, but I had forgot to count the number of attempts; this has been corrected.
2 Extend range of "time.f" subroutine from a limit of ~2017 to about 2040.
3 Increased dimensions such that est_noise can analyze 32 years of daily observations (rather than 22 years)

Version 20170721
1  In bust_5, modified the time format in reject.out such that it becomes, more or less, human
   readable.
2  CRITICAL!!!  In original code of est_noise7.22, the gauss-markov parameter was set to 0.9 rather
   than 0.0 for the second filter.  This would impact results for FLRW noise models or any noise model
   for which the index of the second power-law was held fixed
3  For ModType=f (fast), fix the output of max.dat to reflect the actual number of observations analyzed

Version 20170901
1  Wrote a report, Threshold_dMLE.pdf, that discusses how to identify the optimum noise model after
   using est_noise to test various models of noise. It strongly cautions one not to rely on the estimates
   of error bar for rate obtained from any Gauss-Markov model where the power spectra flattens at the lowest
   frequency.
2  Modified cleanEst.sh, script, in example0 to NOT compute rates and sinusoids if desired. The new script,
   at least for now, is called cleanEst_special.sh

Version 20171025
1  Fixed bug in NedlerMeadSimplex script computing rtol using RMS. Eliminated possibility of getting negative
   rtol from a negative denominator.
2  Revised report, Threshold_dMLE.pdf, using more simulations (5000 vs a few hundred)

Version 20190101
  Updated 20190101 EstNoiseAll.sh script --  output from time dependent models are push to the directory from which
   EstNoiseAll.sh was invoked
  To the cleanEst.sh script, added another option for different sampling intervals.  Default is daily sampling;

Version 20210501
1  When comparing rate and its uncertainty with Hector using GGM noise, found that est_noise (and Simon Williams'
  cats underestimated the rate uncertainty and provided 'uncorrected' rates. Modified est_noise for
  the additive covariance matrix to insert 'pseudo' missing data prior to the time series with a
  length of 3/alpha (alpha being the GGM freq in rad/yr).  This resolves the differences
  between Hector and est_noise.  Note that this is not implemented for the legacy, quadrature covariance; at least
  not yet
2 To cleanEst.sh  added -M option where one can specify the noise model (and its parameters); the default
  (ie, with no -M) is a generic, GPS noise model of RW+FL+WN noise.

Version 20210601
1 various fixes in funmin in cholesky decomposition introduced in version20210501

Version 20220909  --  More fixes concerning GGM (or FOGM) with GM frequencies that are very low;
   constrain lowest, GM frequency to 0.1*2*pi/tlen  where tlen is the length of the time series
   This change was made in the subroutine pow_law_cov  found in filtfunc.f

Version 20221001 -- 
1   Modified the scripts (cleanEst, EstNoise*, etc.) to use either
   GMT versions 5 or 6.  For version 6, it uses the "classic" mode.
2  Recompiled fortran using the 'license free' version of intel Fortran and its MKL
   libraries.  Created a bin_linux directory that includes statically linked executables
   for linux using the Intel compiler and MKL.  I'm not able to perform the same for Macs.

Oct 24, 2022
added option to cleanEst.sh to NOT calculate the seasonal; (365/182) periods

Nov 1, 2022
Modified est_noise7.30 to output a file, adj.out, that contains the estimates
  of the parameters of the time-dependent model that can be used as an
  input to the adjust_1 program.  This is useful in the case where one might
  decimate the original data set to estimate the time-dependence, then apply
  that time-dependent model to the original, un-decimates time series. In the
  case where the original time-series has more observations than est_noise can
  handle, it may be useful to decimate the time-series.  Otherwise, if one
  wants the detrended data, one can look at the resid.out file.

Dec 18, 2022
Fixed bug where date of initiation of exponential or omori function
  was NOT passed into the subroutine modify_A; hence this made the A
  matrix singular and yielded 'bogus' values of the time constant
  and amplitude of exponential/omori functions. This problem only
  occurred when the time constant was estimated (float).
