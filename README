This contains all the software used by the current version of est_noise.
est_noise is a linear regression program to estimates various
functional relations in time seriers (ie, rate, offsets, etc) and,
importantly, estimates the parameters that describe the temporal correlations
such that the estimated values of the functional relations are 'relatively'
unbiased (ie, representing the true values).

This package includes "the manual". For both Linux and Mac, I provide
Makefiles for both gfortran and ifort (Intel Fortran).  These are located
in the "src" directory.


The directory "example" provides the input file and sample data to test est_noise.
The input file is anotated .. but, please read the manual

The directory "example0" provides some scripts that use all of the
executables to assist with analyzing time series data. Please read the manual.

For the interested user, there are three other reports provided:
Langbein_Geod_2017.pdf  -- explains the method of how est_noise works
Threshold_dMLE_v5.pdf  -- describes how to select the "best" noise model
     that models the temporal correlation
GGMproblemFixed.pdf  -- describes the modification of the original est_noise (v7.22)
    to fix the problem of incorrectly computing the rate and its uncertainty when
    a Gauss-Markov process is used to describe the temporal correlations.

Older versions of est_noise can be found at:
https://escweb.wr.usgs.gov/share/langbein/Web/OUT/est_noise/
and
https://escweb.wr.usgs.gov/share/langbein/Web/OUT/est_noise_legacy/

The current version has two modes, one that replicates the legacy version (with
bug-fixes) and the second method follows Langbein_Geod_2017.pdf.
